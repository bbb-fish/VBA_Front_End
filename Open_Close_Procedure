DOCUMENTATION OF THE CODE - DO NOT TRY TO RUN THIS

VBA Code Documentation – Open_Close_Procedure – RCL Library Change Document

Whenever the user grabs the workbook off of the SharePoint and opens it, 
this procedure runs to make data updates seemless and users can’t manipulate data.

Sub Opening_Procedure()  <- Creating the Opening Procedure

Dim ws As Worksheet <- assigning ws to Worksheet
Dim pwd As String <- assigning pwd to a string value

'Turns off screen updating
Application.ScreenUpdating = False
https://excelribbon.tips.net/T009151_Turning_Off_Screen_Updating.html
This keeps the screen from looking like a crazy mess as updates are calculated. 
Otherwise, the screen would be spazzing out during processing.

'Makes the Data sheet visible to be used later in process
'Worksheets("Data Tab").Visible = True
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/excel-vba/articles/worksheet-visible-property-excel
Makes the Data Tab viewable for the user. 
The data tab is where the future SQL pulls will be storing information to build the user view tables.


'Unlocks all worksheets
'pwd = "test" ' Put your password here <- Set the password
'For Each ws In Worksheets <- Unprotects all worksheets
'    ws.Unprotect Password:=pwd <- Unprotects all worksheets
'Next ws <- Unprotects all worksheets

End Sub <- Ends the creation of the Opening Procedure

Sub Closing_Procedure() <- Creating the Closing Procedure

Dim ws As Worksheet <- assigning ws to Worksheet
Dim pwd As String <- assigning pwd to a string value

'Worksheets("Data Tab").Visible = xlSheetVeryHidden
Hides the Data Sheet so that it can only be unhidden with VBA. 
The sheet will not appear in the unhide option of the User Interface. 
This will prevent users from being able to see and change what is 
pulled from the library and only allows them to perform changes using 
the workbook’s instructions.

'Screen updating is turned back on now that the macro is finished running.
Application.ScreenUpdating = True <- Removes the false screen updating

'Locks all worksheets <- Assigns password to all sheets
'pwd = "test" ' Put your password here <- Assigns password to all sheets
'For Each ws In Worksheets <- Protects all worksheets
'    ws.Protect Password:=pwd <- Protects all worksheets
'Next ws <- Protects all worksheets

End Sub <- Ends the creation of the Closing Procedure
